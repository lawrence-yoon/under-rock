/* colors, i want to use green and blue if possible. */
/* we want to aim for 40-60 characters per line, makes blocks of text easier to read. */
/* font, i want to go sans serif, possibly humanist? i think thats what its called */
/* alignment. consistent alignment, like left aligned. reduce number of alignment points. text start lines, components. maybe use grid? */
/* white space. add a lot of white space, make it look for expensive. more minimalist. not bullshit. */
/* audience. who is this for? im thinking, no nonsense, like the newspaper. */

/* i think im going to make it like a carousel. no automatic moving, but able to slide. */
/* this will be SPA, maybe react router at the top, click and goes to #weather #apnews #hackernews */
/* the first item will be the weather "widget". subsequent ones are the news. style them a bit differently. */
/* im thinking of using F pattern. */

/* for accessibility, maybe stack it for scrolling in mobile, but on larger displays, horizontal?*/
