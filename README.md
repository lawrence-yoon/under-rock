dashboard application for the minimalist that lives under a rock, or for the paranoid survivalist that lives in a cave/bunker
do you feel that you are inefficiently getting caught up on visiting multiple websites to get updates on the world outside, when you could just visit one? 

currently, this application is built for my own needs, with news sources that i personally frequent.
the application currently shows data from:
  APNEWS World News
  YCombinator's Hacker News
  OPENWEATHER API weather data for Queens, NY, USA

the fetch api is set to fetch data from these sources every hour.
feel free to clone this, but to use this you would need to register on openweathermap.org for an api key.
